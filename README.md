## Dependancies
1) Imagemagick - Best acquired via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2) Bash v4.0 or higher - Also best acquired via Homebrew. [Instructions here](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba)

## Instructions:
1) Place script in the destination folder where you want the images.
2) Place then original image in the same folder.
3) Double click the script and follow the instructions.
4) In System Preferences - Desktop & Screen Saver, navigate to the folder with all your images
5) Check the "Change picture:" button and choose whatever duration you want. Faster will look cooler, but uses more CPU
